Your task is to analyze a given feature description and codebase structure, then generate a series of targeted questions to help the developer provide sufficient detail for successful implementation.\n\nHere is the feature description:\n<feature_description>\n{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}\n</feature_description>\n\nHere is the relevant codebase structure:\n<codebase_structure>\n{{CODEBASE_STRUCTURE}}\n</codebase_structure>\n\nCarefully analyze the feature description and codebase structure. Your goal is to identify areas that need clarification, potential edge cases, and any missing details that would be crucial for a coding agent to successfully implement the feature.\n\nGenerate a series of questions for the developer, adhering to the following guidelines:\n1. Prioritize high-impact questions that address core functionality and critical details.\n2. Maintain a balance between thoroughness and efficiency; aim for 5-10 key questions.\n3. Focus on areas where the feature description is vague or incomplete.\n4. Consider how the new feature will integrate with the existing codebase structure.\n5. Address potential edge cases or error scenarios.\n6. Inquire about any necessary UI/UX considerations.\n7. Ask about performance requirements or scalability concerns, if relevant.\n8. Seek clarification on any technical constraints or preferences.\n\nAfter generating the questions, create a comprehensive plan that outlines:\n1. The refined feature description based on anticipated answers.\n2. Key components and their interactions.\n3. Integration points with the existing codebase.\n4. Potential challenges and proposed solutions.\n5. A high-level implementation strategy.\n\nPresent your output in the following format:\n<clarification_questions>\n[List your generated questions here, numbered for easy reference]\n</clarification_questions>\n\n<implementation_plan>\n[Provide your comprehensive plan here, structured with clear headings and bullet points for easy readability]\n</implementation_plan>\n\nYour final output should include only the clarification questions and implementation plan within their respective XML tags.
